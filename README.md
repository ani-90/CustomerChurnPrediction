# CustomerChurnPrediction
                                            Predicting Customer Churn using Machine Learning



The primary goal behind the project is to identify the factors influencing increasing churn rates . The project explores various machine learning models which will 
predict whether the customer will churn or not. Proper exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing has been done before delving into modelling.

For the modelling part, the following were used...

1)Logistic Regression
2) SVM
3) Random Forest
4) Decision Tree
5) Gausian Naive Bayes


At the end, it was concluded that Logistic Regression performed the best
